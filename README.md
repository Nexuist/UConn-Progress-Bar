# Uconn Progress Bar

Inspired by @ProgressBar201X and @year_progress on Twitter, we decided to try something similar but with a UConn twist.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
* [Twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) - Twitter API Client for node
* [Cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron) - Tool to run code on a schedule
* [Twitter Developer Account + App](https://developer.twitter.com/) - Requires your own App tokens

### Installing

Create your Developer Account from the link above then go [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) to create an app. Copy the app information from Details -> Keys and tokens to the exampleconfig.js file then rename the file to config.js. Then you can run the project from test.js in an IDE such as WebStorm or in a terminal with `node test.js`.
